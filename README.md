# CAS-SHA-256

This comes from the Casualty Actuarial Society's publication, "Actuarial Review" Nov/Dec. 2021. 
The "It's a Puzzlement" section gave this challenge:

This month’s puzzle is to find a nonce that when appended to “Casualty Actuarial Society” results in a 
hash with at least 20 leading binary 0s (same as at least 5 leading 0s in hexadecimal representation)

This program is one way to explore the space. 

Thanks to Geraint Luff for the Javascript implementation of SHA-256.
